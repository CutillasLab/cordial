A Pleasant Tonic For Convenient Correlation Analysis In R

Computes pairwise Pearson's correlations of a dataset, or 
specified targets simultaneously in parallel. Conveniently includes the 
ability to filter the input dataset and select a subset of columns to 
compute correlations. Outputs Pearson's product moment correlation 
coefficients, p-values, adjusted p-values, and observation counts in 
long-format.
